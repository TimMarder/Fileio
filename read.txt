I am not unmindful that some of you have come here
out of great trials and tribulation. Some of you have
come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have
come from areas where your quest for freedom left you
battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by
the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans
of creative suffering.
